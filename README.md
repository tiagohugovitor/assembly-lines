# Assembly Lines Algorithms Comparison

This project implements and compares different algorithms for assembly line scheduling problem. It includes a recursive algorithm using brute force and other algorithm using dynamic programming technique.

## Project Context

This project was part of an assignment for the Analysis of Algorithms course in the Master's program in Computer Science at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia (UFU). The presentation file can be found in 'assembly-lines.pdf' (presentation in Portuguese).

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Recursive Algorithm with Brute Force**
   - Calculates the best path between two assembly lines to get to the end of the line faster.

2. **Dynamic Programming Algorithm**
   - Uses dynamic programming to calculate the best path between two assembly lines, adding a new structure to avoid recalculating subproblems.

## Files

- **assemblyLinesBruteForce.py**: Implementation of the recursive brute force algorithm.
- **assemblyLinesDynamicProgramming.py**: Implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm.
- **compareAlgorithms.py**: Script to compare the execution time of all algorithms across a range of input sizes.

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tiagohugovitor/assembly-lines.git
   cd assembly-lines
   ```

2. Run the comparison script:
    ```bash
    python compareAlgorithms.py
    ```

3. Results:
    - Execution time graphs saved in the results directory.
    - Dataframe with execution times saved as results/dataframe-{inputSize}.xlsx.

## Algorithms Analysis

### Time Complexity
 - **Recursive Algorithm with brute force**: O(2^n)
 - **Dynamic Programming Algorithm**: O(n)

### Conclusion
The brute force recursive algorithm has a time complexity of O(2^n) which is due to the recalculation of subproblems. This approach quickly becomes infeasible to execute due to its high execution time.

By utilizing dynamic programming, we achieve a linear time complexity algorithm. However, this technique increases the space complexity as it requires storing the already calculated subproblems, resulting in a linear space complexity as well.
