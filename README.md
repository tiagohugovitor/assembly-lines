# assembly-lines
This repository contains the implementation and comparison of two algorithms for solving the assembly line scheduling problem. The algorithms are implemented using two distinct approaches: recursion and dynamic programming. The goal is to compare the efficiency of both approaches in terms of execution time and computational complexity.
